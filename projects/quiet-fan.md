# Quiet Fan Development

**Dates:** Sept 2023 – May 2024  
**Type:** Team project  
**Role:** Contributor (design + testing + analysis)

## Overview
Developed and validated design improvements for a low-noise cooling fan through measurement-driven iteration, balancing airflow performance with acoustic noise.

## My Contributions
- Planned and executed lab tests to evaluate airflow and acoustic behavior.
- Supported design iteration by interpreting test results and identifying tradeoffs (airflow vs noise).
- Helped refine the testing approach to improve repeatability and confidence in results.
- Documented outcomes and engineering reasoning for design decisions.

## Results / Impact
- Established a practical design → test → refine workflow using real measurements.
- Produced test-backed insights to guide design choices.
- (Optional) Add metrics here later: noise reduction (dB), airflow change, test repeatability improvements, etc.
