# Fast Estimation of Local Marginal Prices (LMPs)  
**Final Year Project | Sept 2025 – May 2026 (In progress)**

---

## One-line summary
Developing a fast estimation workflow to predict **ΔLMP** under system variations, significantly reducing the need for repeated optimization-based LMP computations.

---

## What I built
- Designed a **scenario-based estimation workflow** mapping system modifications to predicted ΔLMP.
- Implemented a **benchmarking pipeline** comparing estimator accuracy and runtime against reference LMP solutions.
- Built a **time-series evaluation setup** to validate performance across multiple operating points rather than a single snapshot.
- Automated experiments, metrics, and plots for reproducible evaluation.

---

## Technical focus
- **Problem type:** power systems pricing, sensitivity estimation  
- **Key concepts:** LMPs, optimization-based reference solutions, surrogate / fast estimation, time-series validation  
- **Metrics:** MAE, worst-case error, error distributions, runtime per scenario, speedup factor  
- **Operating conditions:** congested vs non-congested cases, varying perturbation magnitudes

---

## Tools
- Python (experiments, benchmarking, plotting, workflow automation)  
- MATLAB (modeling and validation support)
- Excel  (data results and comparison)

---

## Current status / results (in progress)
- Baseline and scenario generation pipeline established  
- Estimation workflow implemented and iteratively refined  
- Benchmarking plots and summary tables under active development  

> *(Final quantitative results will be added upon project completion.)*
