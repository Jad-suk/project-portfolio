# Star-Saber Interactive Game System

**Dates:** Jan 2025 – May 2025  
**Type:** Team project

## Overview
A team-built interactive embedded system focused on responsive behavior and reliable hit detection, improved through iterative testing and calibration.

## My Contributions
- Contributed to the system design and integration approach for sensing + interaction flow.
- Implemented and refined hit-detection logic and helped reduce false triggers through testing.
- Tuned parameters to improve responsiveness and repeatability across different use cases.
- Supported debugging and validation during real-world trials to improve stability.

## Team Deliverables
- Working system prototype and demo-ready behavior.
- Documented design decisions and testing outcomes.
