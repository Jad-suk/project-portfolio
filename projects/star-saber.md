# Star-Saber Interactive Game System

**Dates:** Jan 2025 – May 2025  
**Type:** Team project

## Overview
Designed and built an interactive embedded game system with real-time hit detection and feedback, optimized for responsiveness and reliability through iterative testing and calibration.

## My Contributions
- Designed and implemented hit-detection logic using sensor fusion (accelerometer, load cell,      distance sensing) to distinguish valid strikes from noise.
- Reduced false trigger events through threshold tuning, filtering, and real-world testing.
- Calibrated system parameters to ensure consistent response timing and repeatability across       multiple users.
- Debugged timing, sensor noise, and integration issues on ESP32 (C/C++), improving overall        system stability.
- Participated in system integration and validation, contributing to a demo-ready prototype.

## Team Deliverables
- Working system prototype and demo-ready behavior.
- Documented design decisions and testing outcomes.
