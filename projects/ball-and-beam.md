# Ball-and-Beam Control System 

**Dates:** Sept 2024 – Dec 2024  
**Type:** Team project

## Overview
Modeled and controlled an unstable ball-and-beam system using feedback control, with validation through simulation and performance checks against design targets.

## Problem
The ball-and-beam system is inherently unstable: small beam angle changes can cause large ball motion, requiring closed-loop control for stability and tracking.

## Approach
- Developed the mathematical model of the system and implemented it in simulation.
- Designed a feedback controller and tuned it to meet stability and performance requirements.
- Validated performance using simulated step/reference tracking and disturbance response.

## Results
- Achieved stable closed-loop behavior in simulation.
- Produced response plots demonstrating tracking and improved stability.
